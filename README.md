# ethmusicgen

## Overview
EthMusicGen was supposed to be a decentralized application that generates randomsongs and stores hashes of them on the Ethereum blockchain. Further, it allowed others to listen to these songs for a fee.

It is an unfinished project as I no longer has interest in finishing it. But,
I completed the smart contract (which was the main goal of this project) and all that is needed is to implement the music generation and write a front-end.
